Web inventory application project

In this project, I will build a simple inventory management application for a single resource. That resource that I selected were gluten-free snacks. Through this application, I will be able to visually display a few resources, remove some of those resources, and create new resources. This project will showcase DOM manipulation plus the usage of CSS and HTML. 


Added an image to showcase some of the snacks.
Added DOM manipulation.
Added the forms so that they can be in touch and receive the latest updates.
