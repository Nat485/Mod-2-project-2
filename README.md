Web inventory application project

In this project, I will build a simple inventory management application for a single resource. That resource that I selected were gluten-free snacks. Through this application, I will be able to visually display a few resources, remove some of those resources, and create new resources. This project will showcase DOM manipulation plus the usuage of CSS and HTML.
